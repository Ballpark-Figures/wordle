# wordle video — specifics

wordle-only conventions. The shared cross-video rules (`bpkfigures/CLAUDE.md`)
and private operational notes (`dotclaude/CLAUDE.md`) load via the two imports
below. Those two names are **real files inside this repo** — gitignored copies,
refreshed at every session start by `dotclaude/hooks/refresh-claude-imports.py`.
They cannot be symlinks: a CLAUDE.md `@import` will not resolve to a target
outside the project directory, by any route. See `yahtzee/CLAUDE.md` "Config
loading" for the measurements and the full cross-machine history.

> **Import canary — check this first.** If you cannot see the tokens
> `SHARED-RULES-LOADED` and `PRIVATE-RULES-LOADED` in your context, the imports
> above **silently failed** and you are missing every shared and private
> convention. The copies are machine-local and gitignored, so the usual cause is
> a repo where they were never created — a fresh clone that has not had
> `/sync-videos` run in it, so `.claude/settings.local.json` (and therefore the
> refreshing hook) does not exist yet. Recover by reading `bpkfigures/CLAUDE.md`
> and `dotclaude/CLAUDE.md` directly for this session, then regenerate the copies
> with `python3 ../../dotclaude/hooks/refresh-claude-imports.py .` and tell the
> user to run `/sync-videos`.

> Do **not** trust a hook that claims to inject the rules as context: a
> SessionStart hook emitting the full ~121KB gets capped by the harness, saved to
> a file, and replaced with a ~2KB preview — which contains
> `SHARED-RULES-LOADED` and so reads as success while almost everything is
> missing. The tokens only mean anything when they come from the imports.

## Script
- `animations/Script.md` is the video script. Scenes become
  `scenes/NN<name>.py`. (Fill in this video's script/scene conventions.)

## Math / data
- `math/data/` holds source data & pipeline outputs; `math/notebooks/` holds
  Jupyter exploration. NEW data files go here, NOT `animations/assets/` (that's
  render-time scene data caches + visuals).
- Split solver outputs by git status: `math/data/shared/<solver>/` is
  **committed** (final results/trees, meant to sync between machines);
  `math/data/local/<solver>/` is **gitignored** (resume checkpoints / memo
  pickles — regenerable, can be GBs). `math/data/local/` is in `.gitignore`.

## Solver (exact optimal turns per opener)
- `math/solver/` is the C solver computing the exact minimum expected turns for
  every one of the 12972 openers, plus each one's optimal tree. **Read
  `math/solver/README.md` first** — build, flags, output format, gotchas.
- The objective is an INTEGER (total guesses over all 2315 answers), so results
  are exact, not float-compared. Validate any solver change with
  `bash solver/validate.sh` from `math/`: SALET 7920, REAST 7923, TRACE/CRATE
  7926, SLATE 7928 (Bertsimas & Paskov Table 1, reproduced exactly).
- Long sweep resumes with `bash ~/bin/resume-jobs.sh` (skips finished openers
  via the CSV, warm-starts the transposition table from `tt.bin`). A Windows
  Scheduled Task runs the same script at boot so a forced Windows Update
  restart self-recovers.
- Outputs follow the shared/local split: **`math/data/shared/optturns/opener_totals.csv`**
  is the committed result that syncs between machines;
  `math/data/local/optturns/` holds the regenerable bulk (`trees/`, `tt.bin`,
  `sweep.log`, `archive/`).
- `math/tools/` holds the analysis scripts, all importing `paths.py` for
  locations. **`python3 math/tools/report.py`** is the standing status report
  (progress, best/worst, 0.01-bin histogram with percentiles, slowest solves);
  also `lookup.py` (rank named openers), `vowels.py`, `depths.py` (tree depth +
  tree-vs-CSV check), `ttdump.py`/`ttverify.py`/`ttscan.py` (table snapshots).

## Gameplay layout
- (Describe this video's on-screen layout and the assets in `animations/assets/`.)

## Style
- Uses `bpkfigures` style + the local `config.py` for colors/fonts.
